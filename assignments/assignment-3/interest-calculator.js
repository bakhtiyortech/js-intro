// Interest Calculator
// Declare variables principal, rate, and time, assigning them appropriate values for an interest calculation (you can decide the values). 
//Compute the simple interest with the formula Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 and store it in a variable interest. 
//Log the interest to the console.

var principal = 500;
var rate = 4.99;
var time = 7;
var interest = (principal * rate *time) / 100;
console.log("Your interest:", interest);
